BLOCKING WEBSITES-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Test-loop is a program that can be run to check that site blocking works ok. Start a command prompt,
cd to this directory and run '''python Test-loop.py'''. It will attempt to block the sites in sites.txt
on your system.


sites.txt lists the site URLs that will be blocked when Alcolock thinks you are highly intoxicated (red region of graph 
display). Each URL is begun on a new line. Editing the file while the Alcolock program is running will not have 
any effect on site blocking - it must be edited beforehand (hopefully when you're sober).

medium.txt lists sites that will be blocked when Alcolock thinks you are slightly drunk (yellow region of graph display).
The format is the same as sites.txt.
