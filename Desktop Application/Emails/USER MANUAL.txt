EMAILS AND RECIPIENTS------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Folder Config

In userconfig.json, you specify your email address (under field "user"), your password (under field "password")
and the platform you want to use to send the email e.g. gmail, outlook, yahoo (under field "server"). 
NOTE: Make sure that you don't let other people see this file as they will be able to find out your email password! 

In Recipients.csv, you list all the people you want to send emails to, their email address and the subject of the email.
The three columns in the excel file correspond to these details. You can list as many people as you like.

Emailbindings.json links different platforms to the URLs of their smtp servers. If you have knowledge in this domain, you can
add more bindings (e.g. if you want to use yahoo, you need to find the URL of the smtp server for yahoo and add it to the file).



Folder Messages

This folder contains all the messages that you want to send to different people. You create a different text (.txt extension)
file for each recipient in which you write what you want to send to that person. You can do this using any text editor. The file
should be called {recipient name}_email.txt. For example, an email for Mr Anderson would result in the file "Mr Anderson_email.txt".


ADDITIONAL NOTES:
Initially Gmail will not allow you to sed emails using this application. There is a small setting on your Google account that you
need to adjust. To fid out more, go to: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255#zippy=%2Cif-less-secure-app-access-is-on-for-your-account
